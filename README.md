# 👋 Hi, I'm **Samiran**
- Currently work with Otto Media remotely as a Senior Data Strategist. It’s a leading SEO agency in Canberra, Australia. I also consult with NGOs & Social Impact Organisations, agencies and teams focused on elections or policy.
- Translate official datasets into stories, reports, and visual packs that build trust, clarify impact, and support decisions.
- Combine data analysis with plain-language explanations and media-ready narratives that non-technical audiences can act on.

# **What you can expect**
- A clear storyline anchored in credible public or official datasets, tailored to your audience’s questions and doubts.
- Explanations in accessible language, with charts, comparisons, and examples that show why the data matters for your campaign, policy, or brand.
- A focus on outcomes: improving understanding, strengthening trust, and giving your team material they can reuse in decks, media, or donor communication.

# **Consulting Deliverables**
- **Trust-building data story**: Long-form narrative or research report that explains your impact using official statistics and your internal data, written for citizens, donors, or stakeholders.
- **Visual insight pack**: Charts, maps, and key figures that your team can plug into presentations, media kits, or policy notes.
- **Issue briefs & explainers**: Short, focused documents that unpack one topic with data-backed arguments.
