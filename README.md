# 👋 Hi, I'm **Samiran**
- I help NGOs & Social Impact Organisations, SMEs, agencies and teams focused on elections or policy. I Currently work with Otto Media remotely as a Senior Data Strategist. It’s a leading SEO agency in Canberra, Australia. 
- Translate official datasets into stories, reports, and visual packs that build trust, clarify impact, and support decisions.
- Combine data analysis with plain-language explanations and media-ready narratives that non-technical audiences can act on.

## My Core Insight Framework

Across NGOs & Social Impact Organisations, SMEs, agencies and teams focused on elections or policy:

**Data → Context → Insight → Narrative → Decision**

### Core Deliverables (Common)
- Insight Brief (what the data is really saying)
- Visual Insight Pack (clear, decision-ready visuals)
- Context & Gap Note (what’s missing, what’s misaligned)
- Strategic Narrative (trust, impact, or public positioning)
- Strategy Call (interpretation & next steps)
- Survey Design & Analysis

# **For NGOs & Social Impact Organisations**
- **Data-Backed Donor Narrative**: Story of your organisation's impact, grounded in official data and your internal metrics, tailored for funder conversations and campaign materials.
- **Situation Assessment**: Diagnostic report using internal data and public datasets to establish the problem your programme addresses, with context, scale, and affected populations.
- **Programme Context & Gap Note**: Evidence-based brief positioning your work within the larger ecosystem, who else is working on this, what gaps exist, why your approach matters.
- **Impact & Change Narrative**: Long-form story demonstrating how your programme contributes to measurable change, using beneficiary data, official outcomes, and logic models.
